# Dummy-Variables
In statistics and econometrics, particularly in regression analysis, a dummy variable is one that takes only the value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some 
categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome. They can be thought of as numeric stand-ins for qualitative facts in a regression model, sorting data into mutually 
exclusive categories (such as smoker and non-smoker).
